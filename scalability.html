    <div class="document" id="git-db-scalability">
<h1 class="title">git db scalability</h1>
<p>This standard is primarily intended to be scalable from small to
large, while still giving the convenience of being able to 'check out'
repositories and inspect their contents, while being fully auditable.</p>
<div class="section" id="embedded-use-cases">
<h1>Embedded use cases</h1>
<p>In the embedded case, table primitives used for a git DB
implementation are used directly.  This allows for useful applications
from early implementations even before query systems are developed.</p>
<p>&quot;embedded&quot; this usually means &quot;phone&quot; these days, and mobile
applications should benefit from the small data size requirements of
git-db tables and efficient synchronization.</p>
<p>A basic implementation need only care for <a class="reference external" href="design/encoding.html">encoding</a> and <a class="reference external" href="design/treeformat.html">tree
format</a>, and its <a class="reference external" href="design/meta.html">meta.</a> schema can be fixed.  On connection, it
just has to compare the <tt class="docutils literal">meta</tt> schema to its own data, or perhaps
even just the revision/URL stored in the <tt class="docutils literal">meta.namespace</tt> table.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sqlite-use-case">
<h1>SQLite use case</h1>
<p>In this case, a C-ISAM-type library like SQLite is engineered to
connect to the git db store using shared libraries.  In this picture
the application would be linked with a git db library and libgit2, and
access the git store directly.  Unlike C-ISAM, it could support
concurrent writers.  Also unlike C-ISAM, it would use an append-only
store, which is much less subject to jamming.</p>
<p>The command-line &quot;sqlite&quot; utility could work, as it can read the
application's table structure from the <a class="reference external" href="design/meta.html">meta.</a> application schema,
and know what tables and properties exist in the store.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distributed-use-case">
<h1>Distributed Use Case</h1>
<p>This is another</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rdbms-use-case">
<h1>RDBMS use case</h1>
<p>In this case, git db tables are engineered underneath an RDBMS as a
storage layer.  This could be as a MySQL engine, or even a port of
Postgres to it.</p>
<p>As there is an RDBMS engine present, it handles transactional
integrity on contents itself.  The main benefit of this is
replication for readers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clustered-rdbms-use-case">
<h1>Clustered RDBMS use case</h1>
<p>In this case, the RDBMS above is also taught how to replicate the
store and negotiate writers which have successful updates to the
database state (ie, commits).  This allows some horizontal scaling of
complex update transactions (assuming every node can hold a clone of
the repository).</p>
<p>This is something of a cross between the RDBMS case (where git-db does
not get visibility of extra transactional integrity information), and
the distributed use case.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharded-partition-use-case">
<h1>Sharded partition use case</h1>
<p>In this mode, the store is broken up into submodules, with writes to
each submodule managed by a different independent worker process or
even computing node.</p>
<p>As the <a class="reference external" href="design/treeformat.html">tree format</a> specifies that trees can be split into arbitrary
nesting, data sets with natural partition boundaries (eg, users,
sites, domains) can be sharded by ranges of primary keys.  Node A
might have keys from A-C, Node B keys from D-G, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whole-hadoop-use-case-map-reduce">
<h1>Whole Hadoop use case (Map/Reduce)</h1>
<p>Map/Reduce is where a problem is chunked up into parts, and then
farmed out to many nodes, which all compute a part calculation (&quot;map&quot;)
and then the result is condensed into a result (&quot;reduce&quot;).  Hadoop is
an open source implementation of this.</p>
<p>In this mode, the system is distributed at the object store layer;
re-use of low level components such as libgit2 are less likely, or
lower level.  The simplest implementation would be equivalent in
functionality to the &quot;Embedded&quot; case, above.</p>
<p>git db has characteristics which suit this approach.  As the commit id
summarizes a known and immutable database state, this already solves
many of the problems encountered by mutable state systems.  Nodes can
process their result in terms of that commit ID, allowing for what are
effectively long-running transactions.  Update jobs could potentially
work incrementally at little extra incurred cost.</p>
<p>For very large data sets, there's no reason you really need to keep
the history forever.  For ETL systems, you would probably only keep
condensed summaries and not raw data in the actual clonable history;
the &quot;extracts&quot;.</p>
