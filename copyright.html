<p>Below follows the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license.
  Trolls take particular note of clause 2.7.

<pre>
Licence
<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
<p>This Creative Commons New Zealand Public Licence enables You (all
capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and
distribute Works worldwide, under the terms of this licence, provided
that You credit the Original Author.
<p>“The Licensor”
<p>   and
<p>“You”
<p>agree as follows:
<p>1. Definitions
<p>    * “Adaptation” means any work created by the editing,
      modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media
      (however a work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence). For
      the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition
      or sound recording, the synchronisation of the Work in
      timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
      considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence.
<p>    * “Applicable Licence” means one of the licences described in
      clause 2.3(a), (b) or (c).
<p>    * “Attribution” means acknowledging all the parties who have
      contributed to and have rights in the Work or Collection under
      this Licence; and “Attribute” has a corresponding meaning.
<p>    * “Collection” means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form
      along with one or more other separate and independent works,
      assembled into a collective whole.
<p>    * “Creative Commons Compatible Licence” means a license that is
      listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
      been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
      equivalent to this Licence, including, at a minimum, because
      that licence: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose,
      meaning and effect as the Licence Elements of this Licence; and,
      (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works
      made available under that licence under this Licence or a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same Licence
      Elements as this Licence.
<p>    * “Licence” means this Creative Commons New Zealand Public
      Licence agreement.
<p>    * “Licence Elements” means the following high-level licence
      attributes indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution,
      Share-Alike.
<p>    * “Licensor” means one or more legally recognised persons or
      entities offering the Work under the terms and conditions of
      this Licence.
<p>    * “Original Author” means the individual(s) or entity/ies who
      created the Work.
<p>    * “Work” means the work protected by copyright which is offered
      under the terms of this Licence.
<p>    * “You” means an individual or entity exercising rights under
      this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this
      Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      Licence despite a previous violation.
<p>    * For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the
      context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
<p>2. Licence Terms
<p>  2.1 Subject to the terms of this agreement the Licensor hereby
  grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for
  use and for the duration of copyright in the Work.  You may:
<p>    * copy the Work;
    * create one or more Adaptations. You must take reasonable steps
      to ensure any Adaptation clearly identifies that changes were
      made to the original Work;
    * incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
    * copy Adaptations or the Work as incorporated in any Collection;
      and
    * publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate
      the Work, the Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in any
      Collection, to the public.
<p>  All these rights may be exercised in any material form in any media
  whether now known or hereafter created. All these rights also
  include the right to make such modifications as are technically
  necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
<p>HOWEVER,
<p>You must not:
<p>    * impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the
      Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that
      alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the Applicable
      Licence, as applicable, or any rights granted under it or have
      the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise
      those rights;
<p>    * impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the
      Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that
      alters or restricts the terms of this Licence or any rights
      granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the
      ability to exercise those rights;
<p>    * sublicense the Work;
<p>    * falsely Attribute the Work to someone other than the Original
      Author;
<p>    * subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the
      Copyright Act 1994 provided that if the Licensor is the Original
      Author the Licensor will not enforce this sub-clause to the
      extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
      under clause 2.1 to make Adaptations but not otherwise.
<p>FINALLY,
You must:
<p>    * make reference to this Licence or the Applicable Licence, as
      applicable, (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word
      or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work,
      Adaptations and Collections published, distributed, performed or
      otherwise disseminated or made available to the public by You;
<p>    * recognise the Licensor’s / Original Author’s right of
      Attribution (right to be identified) in any Work, Adaptation and
      Collection that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise
      disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the
      Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used. You
      will however remove such a credit if requested by the
      Licensor/Original Author;
<p>    * not assert or imply any connection with sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author or Licensor of You or Your
      use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
      permission of the Original Author or Licensor; and
<p>    * to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices
      that refer to this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that
      the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
      such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work.
<p>Additional Provisions
<p>2.2. Further licence from the Licensor
<p>  Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
<p>    * the Work; or
    * any Adaptation; or
    * the Work as incorporated in a Collection
<p>  the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use
  of the Work (“User”) (in any of the alternatives set out above) a
  licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as granted
  to You hereunder.
<p>2.3. Further licence from You
<p>  Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
<p>    * an Adaptation; or
    * an Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection
<p>  You agree to offer to the User (in either of the alternatives set
  out above) a licence to use the Adaptation on any of the following
  premises and to comply with such licence:
<p>    * a licence to the Adaptation on the same terms and conditions as
      the licence granted to You hereunder; or
    * a later version of the licence granted to You hereunder with the
      same Licence Elements; or
    * any other Creative Commons licence (whether the Unported or a
      jurisdiction licence) with the same Licence Elements.
    * a Creative Commons Compatible Licence.
<p>2.4. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have
  under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any
  other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright
  infringement.
<p>2.5. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby
  reserved.
<p>2.6. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
  individually or via a licensing body such as a collecting society,
  for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
<p>2.7. If the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor waives its
  moral right to object to derogatory treatments of the Work to the
  extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
  under this Licence to make Adaptations but not otherwise. If the
  Licensor is not the Original Author the Work will still be subject
  to the moral rights of the Original Author.
<p>3. Warranties and Disclaimer
<p>Except as required by law or as otherwise agreed in writing between
the parties, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and
"as available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either
express or implied.
<p>4. Limit of Liability
<p>Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law
the Licensor shall not be liable on any legal basis (including without
limitation negligence) and hereby expressly excludes all liability for
loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
<p>5. Termination
<p>The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
Collections from You under this Licence, however, will not have their
Licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
full compliance with those Licences. Clauses 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will
survive any termination of this Licence.
<p>6. General
<p>6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this
  agreement is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to
  be invalid or unenforceable.
<p>6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the
  parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
  understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
  Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any
  additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any
  form.
<p>6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights
  under the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 to enforce any of its terms.
<p>7. On the role of Creative Commons
<p>7.1. Creative Commons does not authorise either the Licensor or the
  User to use the trade mark “Creative Commons” or any related trade
  mark, including the Creative Commons logo, except to indicate that
  the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence. Any permitted
  use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons trade mark
  usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons trade
  mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website
  or be otherwise available upon request from time to time. For the
  avoidance of doubt this trade mark restriction does not form part of
  this Licence.
<p>7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its
  role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims
  of any Licensor or user of the Licence.
<p>7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires
  of the Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role
  and agreement by all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not
  responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the
  Licensor or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence.
<p>7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and
  makes no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in
  connection to the Licence, and in all events is not liable for any
  loss or damage resulting from the Licensor's or Your reliance on
  this Licence or on its enforceability.
<p>7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS
  THESE CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES
  CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF
  THE LICENCE FROM THE LICENSOR TO YOU.
<p>Creative Commons Notice
<p>Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
Licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
<p>Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorise
the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any
related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior
written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in
compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage
guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made
available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt,
this trademark restriction does not form part of this Licence.
