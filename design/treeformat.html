  <h1 id="title">TreeFormat: arranging data</h1>

<p><h2>TreeFormat basics</h2>
<p>The starting point of the design is to use the schema name at the top
level, table/relation name next, and then within those, a UTF-8
representation of the value of the primary key(s) of the row (or a
UUID if there is no primary key) as the filename within the tree for
the relation.
<p>eg

<pre>
   tracker/ticket/1
   tracker/ticket/2
</pre>
<p>The exact mechanism for converting from a value to the above
representation is type-dependent, and covered by the <a
href="../design/filenames.html">Filename format</a>).  The
mechanism to know what the directory names mean is covered by the <a
href="../design/meta.html">MetaFormat</a>.  To solve the
re-entrancy problem, a "meta" directory exists at the top level which
contains fixed directories such as "class", "types" and "attr".
<p><h2>Dividing large directories</h2>
<p>For relations with a lot of contents, trees can be used.  This is
equivalent to use of nodes in a B-Tree.  The name of a tree can either
be a single value or a range.

<pre>
   tracker/ticket/1-1000/1
   tracker/ticket/1001-2000/1001
</pre>
<p>If it is a value, it must correspond to an entire key column (and
there must be subsequent primary key columns).
<p>The problem of deciding when to divide a large directory, and when to
"rebalance" the tree, so as to try to ensure an even depth of index,
are long-standing data management problems which this specification
will not try to wave a magic wand to make go away.
<p><h2>Official row filenames</h2>
<p>As noted in the <a href="../design/filenames.html">Filename</a>
standard, the "official" filename of the row is that which is stripped
of all of these divisions along the way.  This is important for
heirarchical references to rows, which are always by the "official"
filename.
<p><h2>Row format</h2>
<p>The format of the actual rows is described in the <a href="../design/columnformat.html">ColumnFormat</a>.
<p>If any columns are specified completely in the directory path of the
row, then those columns may be omitted in the stored row(s).  Tree
rebalancers beware.
<p>This does not affect column numbering; the first column is likely to
have a non-zero increment value.
<p><h2>Page format</h2>
<p>Especially if there is a lot of relatively static rows (ie, OLAP
systems), it may make sense to write out "pages", which are a single
emission of packed rows.
<p>This is indicated in the tree by a filename which is a range, but
which is a blob (file) and not a tree (folder/directory).  Another
possibility is that the filename does not completely have all the keys
in the schema listed yet; eg if there are 3 primary key columns, and
you encounter the blob while scanning:

<pre>
  myschema/mytable/customerid,projectid
</pre>
<p>The third key is still expected and so the system knows that the blob
is a page and contains the remaining columns.
<p>For bulk inserts, emitting pages as you go is fair game.
<p>If a row in a page needs to be removed, or a value in between added,
then the page must be split or rewritten.  Most random writers will
use the split policy; rewriting a page for an update should be
considered the same problem as tree rebalancing; don't overdo it,
because it wins you relatively little and slows updates down
tremendously.
