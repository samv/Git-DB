<h1 class="title">Distribution: sharing data</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: a lot of the information on this page is the result of the
author's own knowledge and experience and should currently be counted
as expert opinion grade but not yet proven or formally described.</p>
<div class="section" id="git-db-replication">
<h1>git db replication</h1>
<p>git db as a standard is relatively neutral to how the data is shared.
Actually, git itself solves a number of the mechanical aspect of
distribution problems.  The question frequently becomes, which version
is considered the &quot;master&quot;?</p>
<p>The answer to this depends a lot on what the objectives of the program
are.  There are problems which distributing may help solve, such as
scaling to truly massive sets of data, extra computing power to
service a lot of requests, or resilience in the face of disasters.
There are compromises to be made, such as whether results must be
guaranteed or whether a &quot;best effort&quot; approach is acceptable.</p>
<p>The CAP theorem describes these trade-offs; sacrificing Consistency to
allow tolerance to network Partitions and supply high Availability -
BASE systems fall into this category - or whether Consistency (the &quot;C&quot;
in ACID) must be maintained, at the expense of either Availability
(distributed systems which shut down when there is a partition), or
tolerance to network Partitions (implying that systems must all be on
the same network).</p>
<p>The git db should support all of these styles of replication, through
<em>configuration</em> - not necessarily settings in a config file or dialog
box, but how the application is configured to use which facility of
the git db.  Mixed modes are possible, but in general more restrictive
systems will not be able to share information with less restrictive
systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="single-master-replication">
<h1>Single Master Replication</h1>
<p>In this mode, there is a single node which is the only one allowed to
do updates.</p>
<p>An example of application here is &quot;decentralised social networks&quot;;
holding the databases that people collaboratively edit with each
other, be it a friends list or a photo collection catalogue.  Yet,
many other nodes have an interest in receiving the information.  Each
person is the master of their own database, and everyone else's
versions are comments or suggestions and are not automatically
promoted to be the master.</p>
<p>This is the easiest mode to support; assuming that the single node for
updates does not change, there are no conflicts to resolve.</p>
<p>This case matches the majority of traditional replication systems out
there.</p>
<p>The distribution protocol for this can be standard git protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strict-multi-master-replication">
<h1>Strict Multi-Master Replication</h1>
<p>This mode of replication is appropriate for systems where the list of
changes going into the system are known accurately, and there must be
no conflicting answers.</p>
<p>In this case, the nodes must always return the same result and be
Consistent.  Overall, the system must behave as an ACID system;
transactions must be able to be applied serially and obtain equivalent
results.  To achieve this, a system called 2 Phase Commit is generally
employed, where commits which are &quot;ready&quot; to apply are voted on by
participating nodes and the real result moves forward once there is
agreement.</p>
<p>The system may provide geographical dispersion guarantees on returned
answers, limiting performance but making the system very robust to
localized disasters.  Non-repudiating systems may take this form.</p>
<p>Examples of systems that work like this are clustered ACID databases
(eg Oracle) and the transaction support in earlier versions of
CouchDB.</p>
<p>The interchange of messages relating to this replication could have a
protocol designed for it, or likely a redundant message queue system
like AQMP could just be re-used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lax-multi-master-replication">
<h1>Lax Multi-Master Replication</h1>
<p>This mode of replication is similar to Multi-Master, but several
requirements are relaxed.  It is assumed that any two conflicting
updates can be resolved - called &quot;eventual consistency&quot; (the E in the
bacronym BASE).  More than one node may produce valid updates.</p>
<p>This approach matches the replication approach of many
stored-procedure based database replication systems, such as Bucardo.
Also, current versions of CouchDB.</p>
<p>An advantage of this style of replication is that it doesn't need a
new protocol, you can just synchronize revisions and then apply the
merge resolution rules.  It does however require a way to specify
those merge resolution rules -- for instance, in-store functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="democratic-computing">
<h1>Democratic Computing</h1>
<p>This is the proposed label for a cluster of multi-master nodes, where
no node is trusted fully but every node is trusted equally; a voting
system is used to resolve possible conflicts and auditing is possible.
Additionally, it may be possible to relax strict requirements about
knowing the input requests - answers to these questions should be
available once more research is completed.</p>
<p>This is a similar use case to the Strict Multi-Master protocol,
however the use of an existing message queue system or some kind of
cluster &quot;supervisor&quot; process are not allowed, and the system should be
capable of operation with each node acting in rational self-interest
only.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="partitioning-of-data">
<h1>Partitioning of Data</h1>
<p>The system of <a class="reference external" href="./treeformat.html">dividing tables</a> can be used to take large sets of
data and partition them in either custom ways when using a primary
key, or randomly when using a UUID or a hash for the primary key.</p>
<p>As the full data set is not required when computing results involving
the partitioned chunks - just the SHA1 sums - nodes with incomplete
information can compute some limited results as if they had the full
set.</p>
<p>While this doesn't in principal require a new protocol, the entire
query system will need to be structured so that it can divide the work
by the submodules present in the repository, and farm them out to
nodes which have those submodules.  This is likely a complex approach.</p>
