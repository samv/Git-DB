=============
introduction
=============

git db is an experimental research project, aiming to combine a number
of emergent technologies to enable a new platform of social-networking
building, buzzword-coining computing.

Seriously though, its essence is a hybrid/relational data store, built
to run on top of the git source control management system.  For more
information on its design, see the `design page`_.

There is also a list of `features excluded from the first
specification`_.  If you get lost, my apologies.
