=============
introduction
=============

git db is an experimental research project, aiming to combine a number
of emergent technologies to enable a new platform of social-networking
building, buzzword-coining computing.

Seriously though, its essence is a hybrid/relational data store, built
to run on top of the git source control management system.  The idea
is to use this distributed store for data-centric applications from
turn-based games to public databases such as Freebase, to social
applications from photo-sharing sites to your contacts database.

Being based on git gives a large advantage when it comes to read-only
replication, as this is almost the simplest operation the store
supports.  Already this allows a huge amount of horizontal scalability
of applications.  It's also very convenient for synchronising, as any
developer who has ever had to work on multiple computers and
experienced the liberation of distributed version control knows.  As
every computing result can be completely represented and audited by a
single SHA1 ID, there are also benefits with processing parallel
updates, with transaction integrity able to be parallelized by writers
and not by a central point¹.

This flexible system allows for a number of clustering options for
updates, safe modes from single writer to multi-master with quorum, to
BASE arrangements which tolerate network partitions by providing rules
for handling data differences.  For more on this see scalability_.
